%feature("docstring") OT::LsqSolver
"Least Square Solver (LsqSolver) for a system of non-linear equations.


Parameters
----------
absError : positive float
    Absolute error: distance between two successive iterates at the end point.
    Default is :math:`10^{-5}`.
relError : positive float
    Relative error: distance between the two last successive iterates with
    regards to the last iterate. Default is :math:`10^{-5}`.
resError : positive float
    Residual error: threshold for accepting a given solution. It is also used as residual error for the least square optimizer.
    value. Default is :math:`0`.
maximumFunctionEvaluation : int
    The maximum number of evaluations of the function. Default is :math:`100`.

Notes
-----
LsqSolver might fail and not obtain a result lower than the specified threshold, in this case an error is thrown."
